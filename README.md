# Predicting Housing Prices with Linear Regression 🏡✨

Welcome to my house price prediction project! In this journey, I explored data-driven techniques to unravel the complexities of housing prices. Here’s a detailed overview of the project:

---

## Project Overview

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansed and refined housing datasets, ensuring reliability and consistency for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted a thorough examination of data patterns and relationships among key variables.
- **Feature Engineering:** Designed impactful features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms to enhance predictive power.
- **Model Development:** Built a linear regression model using Python’s scikit-learn library, optimizing parameters for robust performance.
